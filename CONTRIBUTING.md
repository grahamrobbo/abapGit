a. Make sure there is an open issue for the stuff that you want to work on. When starting the development add a comment in the issue. This will allow for discussing possible solutions, and avoid having multiple people look into the same issue.

b. Keep the commits/PR as small as possible, try not to fix multiple issues in one commit/PR if possible. Smaller changes are easier to review, and are more likely to be accepted.

c. Variables are prefixed using the standard setting in Code Inspector check "Extended Naming Conventions for Programs"

d. abapGit is targeted for version 702, so the code should only contain expressions/statements that works on 702

e. commit often, whenever something is working, and is a step in the right direction do a commit or PR. This way other contributors can see the changes, and it will minimize the risk of merge conflicts.
